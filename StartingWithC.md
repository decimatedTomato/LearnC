The following are a series of refernces and videos that involve the c language in a general way

## What is c, why is it used?

## Differences between c and c++
How different are C and C++? Can I still say C/C++?

c++ is misunderstood (should you learn it?)

## Code style decisions
Code overall style (idk I just do what I think looks good)

More specific useful quirks

## Most useful referencing/tools
The book itself (by the creator of c, probably the best existing source)
https://nblok306.ftn.uns.ac.rs/~zoran/A/The_C_Programming_Language.pdf

Another book (lancaster university recommended)
https://onesearch.lancaster-university.uk/permalink/f/84h0d5/44LAN_ALMA_DS51136801210001221

The best standard library and language feature referencing site
https://en.cppreference.com/w/

This seems good as well
https://beej.us/guide/bgc/html/split/index.html

For general programming concepts you can try to find them in wikipedia
https://www.wikipedia.org/
But in case the explanations are too technical you might have to look elsewhere (whoever is behind the mathematical wikipedia articles needs to be shot immediately)
