# Hello!

Let's learn some c!
<br>In this project a basic understanding of programming concepts is expected.
<br>If you are interested in getting started with c you may want to look elsewhere. I did list a series of useful resources in [this file here](StartingWithC.md).
<br>I am planning to add all kinds of basic c components in subdirectories of this project.
<br>Each "part" should include tasks, resources/explanations and a testing program or test instructions. Testing programs most likely only work for people with similar hardware to mine (rip bozo).
<br>I am using gcc x86 version 12.2.0 on a windows machine. At least one of the sections will discuss how to make programs that can easily be compiled for use on different operating systems (preprocessor).

Let me know if there is a way to adjust the teaching style that would be more useful (eg. Long form explanations for provided solutions to tasks).
