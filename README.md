# Introduction to project

Let's learn some c!
<br>In this project a basic understanding of programming concepts is expected.
<br>If you are interested in getting started with c you may want to look elsewhere. I did list a series of useful resources in [this file here](StartingWithC.md).
<br>If you are wondering about the weird tags all over any of these .md files, its called the markdown format, and it gets compiled into html. In lots of viewers you can actually see the prettied up output, for me (in vscode) there's a button with a magnifying glass on the top right.
<br>I am planning to add all kinds of basic c components in subdirectories of this project.
<br>Each "part" should include tasks, resources/explanations and a testing program or test instructions. Testing programs most likely only work for people with similar hardware to mine (rip bozo).
<br>I am using gcc x86 version 12.2.0 on a windows machine. At least one of the sections will discuss how to make programs that can easily be compiled for use on different operating systems (preprocessor).

Let me know if there is a way to adjust the teaching style that would be more useful (eg. Long form explanations for provided solutions to tasks).
<br>You might have to git pull changes as I make improvements/tweaks and add more sections over time.
<br>You know, in a way, parsing and implementing incomprehensible requirements from the client is a big part of being in the computer science industry. Just remember that if you ever find my tasks confusing, or badly phrased ;).
