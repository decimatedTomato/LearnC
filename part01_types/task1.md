There won't be any tests for these tasks (I don't know how to do that yet). After you finish how about you compare your answers to mine: https://github.com/decimatedTomato/LearnC/tree/teacher/part01_types/answers01

# Task 1 - Data types (How to represent that?)

In c, a variable type matters a great deal, they appear at the very start of a variable declaration, before even the variable name. One sensible way of thinking through a program is to consider what sort of data you might need and a sensible way to organize that data is through the type system.

<font color="orange">Create a series of variables which have types that are practical to represent:</font>
- amount of money in a bank account
- someone's age
- text (within 100 characters)
- average grass length
- a day of the week
- a color
- a newline
- a list of true/false settings
- the distance between the moon and the earth
