# Task 5 - Grouping data

Thank josh that we are not limited to homogeneous data structures in c. If you haven't already done so, check out the struct and union usage in the [resources](resources.md#data-structures).

Ah, I made a mistake before. This data structure is not supposed to be for storing only humans, but robots too! It should be one datastructure, of the same size as it already was (we don't have room for redundant data). Robots don't have names though, they have serial numbers.
