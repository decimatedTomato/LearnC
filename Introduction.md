# Hello!

Let's learn some c!
<br> First I am going to link some videos/articles in case you are interested.
<br> I am planning to add all kinds of basic c components in subdirectories of this project.
<br> Each "part" should include tasks, resources/explanations and a testing program or test instructions. Testing programs most likely only work for people with similar hardware to mine (rip bozo).
