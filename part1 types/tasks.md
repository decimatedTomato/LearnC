# Task 1 - Data types

There are many types in c, the same binary string can be interpreted and used in many different ways.
Assign a value to an identifier and print 6 times using various format specifiers using printf.

Since c is a language that must remain fast when run on sorts of hardware the language sometimes conforms to the specific platform --and compiler-- that some software is targeted at. There is no guarantee that all basic types will always be represented in the same way on different devices.
Now create 6 variables of various types, print them as well as their size.

# Task 2 - Days of the week

What type of variable would be practical to use as a representation for a day of the week?
