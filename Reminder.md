# Reminders for how to treat this project

I have two branches:
- master (for the programming resources, tasks and tests)
- teacher (for my solutions, developing the tests etc.)

Write descriptions and add resources only in master.
Write solutions and explanations only in teacher.
Frequently merge changes from master.
